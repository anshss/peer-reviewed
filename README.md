# The Journal Dao

This project allows the free flow of information in a controlled, private and decentralised manner. At the moment it takes an age for proposers to get peer reviewed, sometimes months or maybe years. We make this process the shortest by implementing it over a blockchain.

### About Project
- Users can join the dao as a dao member or as an editor by staking a stake fee.
- Any user can create proposals for getting their papers reviewed by uploading their papers and paying a minimal proposal fee.
- Editors can approve or disapprove these proposals to be put out in dao and get reviewed
- Dao members can read these proposals and vote on them
- If any dao member or editor is found cheating then other members can pass a penalty against him which if voted then his stake would be deducted by 10%.
- For every proposal these members vote or editors approve, they get a portion of the proposal fee added to their return stake.
- Anytime these dao members or editors can leave the dao and their stake would be returned.
- Non-dao members can get access to these articles by paying a one time fee.
